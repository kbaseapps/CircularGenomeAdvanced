# CGView Introduction
CGView generates graphical maps of circular genomes that show sequence features,
base composition plots, analysis results and sequence similarity plots.
It can be used to visualize features associated with any bacterial, plasmid,
chloroplast or mitochondrial genome, and can aid in the identification of conserved genome segments,
instances of horizontal gene transfer, and differences in gene copy number.
