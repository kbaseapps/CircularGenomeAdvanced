parameters :
    input_file :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            Input genome
    linear :
        ui-name : |
            Linear
        short-hint: |
            Whether this genome is linear. Linear genomes are drawn as
            a circle with a line drawn between the start and end of the
            sequence.
    gc_content :
        ui-name : |
            GC Content
        short-hint :
            Whether GC content should be shown.
    gc_skew :
        ui-name : |
            GC Skew
        short-hint :
            Whether GC skew should be shown.
    at_content :
        ui-name : |
            AT Content
        short-hint :
            Whether AT content should be shown.
    at_skew :
        ui-name : |
            AT Skew
        short-hint :
            Whether AT skew should be shown.make
    average :
        ui-name : |
            Average
        short-hint :
            Whether the GC, GC skew, AT, and AT skew plots should show \
            the deviation of each value from the average for the entire \
            genome. The default method of plotting shows each value as \
            calculated. Specifying this allows plots to better show regions \
            that differ from the rest of the genome, but the results cannot be \
            easily distinguish between genomes.
    scale :
        ui-name : |
            Scale
        short-hint :
            Whether the GC, GC skew, AT, and AT skew plots should be \
            scaled to fill the available Y-axis space on the map. This scaling \
            allows differences to be observed more easily, but the results cannot \
            be easily compared between genomes.
    orfs :
        ui-name : |
            Orfs
        short-hint :
            Whether open reading frames (ORFs) should be drawn, with each
            reading frame (1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3) represented by a separated ring.
    combined_orfs :
        ui-name : |
            Combined Orfs ('Orfs' must be selected)
        short-hint :
            Whether open reading frames (ORFs) should be drawn,
            with each strand (forward, reverse) represented by a separate ring.
    orf_size :
        ui-name : |
            Orf Size ('Orfs' must be selected)
        short-hint :
            The minimum length of ORFs (in codons) to show when using
            the 'Orfs' or 'Combined Orfs' options. Default is 100.
    tick_density :
        ui-name : |
            Tick Density
        short-hint :
            The density of the tick marks on the map. Use a
            smaller value to make the ticks less dense.
    details :
        ui-name : |
            Details
        short-hint :
            Whether a sequence information legend should be drawn.
    legend :
        ui-name : |
            Legend
        short-hint :
            Whether a feature legend should be drawn.
    condensed :
        ui-name : |
            Condensed
        short-hint :
            Whether thin feature rings should be used regardless of
            the size of the map.
    feature_labels :
        ui-name : |
            Feature Labels
        short-hint :
            Whether feature labels read from the GenBank or
            EMBL file should be drawn.
    orf_labels :
        ui-name : |
            Orf Labels ('Orfs' must be selected)
        short-hint :
            Whether labels for ORFs that are drawn using the
            'Orfs' or 'Combined_orfs' should be shown.
    show_sequence_features :
        ui-name : |
            Show Sequence Features
        short-hint :
            Whether to draw features contained in the
            supplied Genome, if it is a GenBank or EMBL file.

    output_img:
        ui-name : |
            Output Image
        short-hint : |
            Output image file
